# Course Title

Intro to Programming Concepts

The course would be targeted at students in grades 7-9, with the intention of building
interest and capacity for programming. It could be additionally useful as a first
introduction to programming for students who may be interested in taking the existing 
programming course in Python, but may not have the prerequisite skills to start with 
text-based programming.

# Language Chosen

Scratch/Snap

# How does it work?

Scratch is a block-based language. Blocks are sorted into categories,
and have colors and shapes that help a programmer understand each
block's purpose.

Scratch code runs in the developer platform (either on the website or
on the Scratch app). Whatever is created appears in a window onscreen that can be made 
fullscreen.
Since Scratch appears to be tailored to visual and interactive programs, the resulting
project typically involves games or animations.

# Rate the complexity of the syntax?

The syntax of Scratch is very readable. Commands are written in plain English, and the shape 
and color of the blocks makes for at-a-glance identification of program structures. However, 
the chains of code can become very long for more complex programs. I do not see a way to 
collapse blocks, although the workspace is large and can be organized in any way the user 
prefers.

# Strengths

Scratch's greatest strength is its low barrier to entry. Block code has the advantage of having
structures built in so that programmers can find a command instead of memorizing a large 
selection of commands before they can really get started. It allows for repetition and 
conditional logic, as well as the definition of functions and variables; programmers can 
use the same structures that text-based languages use. Scratch also is focused on the creation 
of visuals, games, and other interactive programs. This is likely to be engaging for new 
programmers who may not expect to enjoy programming or who may not have an innate interest 
in programming for its own sake.

# How would you utilize the strengths in the class?

I would emphasize project-based learning where projects allow for student creativity and
choice. I would also use its accessibility and game-oriented approach as a recruiting tool
to encourage more students, and more diverse populations of students, to try programming.

# Weaknesses

It seems that very large projects on Scratch may develop lag when played. This is unlikely to
become an issue until toward the end of the course, as students will need to develop their
understanding of programming structures before they can create anything too complex. The 
inability to collapse blocks of code will also lead to some inconvenience given that students
would likely be using Chromebooks for the course, thereby being stuck with a small screen.
The use of costumes and sounds for visual and auditory components of programs allows for 
great student creativity, but could definitely become a "rabbit hole" where students dive into
the details of the visuals and sounds instead of creating a working program.

# How would you mitigate the weaknesses in class?

As I mentioned in the previous section, the lag issue is unlikely to arise until toward the
end of the course when projects become larger and more complex. I am curious to know whether
the Scratch app handles large projects better than the web-based platform, which could be one
mitigation strategy. Furthermore, I wonder if speed can be improved by writing shorter blocks
(functions) and utilizing them, where some large projects by students may not instinctively
include this efficiency; I would work with students on how to streamline their programs by
not repeating code. I would mitigate the issue of the small screen by explicitly teaching 
ways students can organize their code to minimize clutter and ensure that they know where their 
blocks are. Finally, I would attempt to reduce the "rabbit hole" temptation of sound and design
by imposing deadlines for sub-tasks in programs, such that students would get a limited amount
of in-class time to work on those tasks to ensure that they can stay on pace for the project.

# Why did you select this language for this class?

This is my first year teaching a CS course of any kind, a Computer Programming course in Python.
Only six students joined, and they are widely varied in grade, experience, and reasoning skills
that contribute to how easily programming comes to them. For one or two of my six students, 
I believe that having some prior exposure to programming concepts and structures would have
helped them to transition into text-based programming more easily. Furthermore, I am imagining a
course that would be available to younger students who might need some extra incentive to be
interested in the course; I believe that a block-based language tailored toward games
would be a great first language for students who have no prior experience with programming.
I am not very knowledgeable about block languages and would certainly do more research before
choosing one; furthermore, my choice would likely be informed by more specific goals in the
course. For example, I am able to borrow Finch robots from my local BOCES; since these work with
the code.org micro:bit block code, I would consider using that platform instead. Regardless,
I would select a block-based language that best aligned with my resources and goals.
