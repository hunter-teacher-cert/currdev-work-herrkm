# Course Title: Block Programming

## Description:

Students in the Block Programming course would learn about programming structures through block code. They would learn to use
variables, flow control structures, and functions. Tasks may include strictly digital assignments as well as robotics (for example,
projects involving Finch robots available through TST BOCES).

## Target Audience:

This course is aimed at students who have never been exposed to programming, or who are interested in programming but need to build some
conceptual understanding before they are ready for text-based programming. The target grade levels would be grades 7-9.

## Where It Fits:

Currently, the only programming course in my school is Computer Programming (a new course this year taught by me). It starts with
the basics (variables and data types) and will cover conditionals and loops, functions, Python data structures like lists, tuples, 
and dictionaries, and program design requiring decomposition into smaller components. Adding a block code course as a prerequisite for
students who may not have prior experience or who are missing some of the math background that is conducive to learning programming
would make the Computer Programming course accessible to more students in the future.
