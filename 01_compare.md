# Background

I understand that the course I selected to compare to does not exactly meet the objective of this assignment - specifically, the course I
chose really isn't the same kind of course that I am teaching. It has a different scope, length, and audience. Still, it has some valuable
components that I would really like to dive into and possibly model some of my own materials after. So while I may have missed the mark on
the prompt for the assignment, please forgive the mismatch while I discuss the ways I can improve my own curriculum.

## My Course: Computer Programming

The course I am teaching and developing curriculum for is called "Computer Programming," but I refer to  as "Intro to Programming" to emphasize
that it is a beginner course. The language used is Python, and we will be using VS Code with the Python extension and the ipykernel package.
As of right now, I have a few weeks' worth of lessons planned and an overall sequence document, with the understanding that it is very much
a living document. I expect to extend lessons over multiple days as needed and add project-based sections, especially as students develop 
greater skills.

By the end of the course, students will be proficient with the following fundamental programming skills:

* Variables
* Basic data types and their operations
* Conditional statements
* Loops
* Input validation and error handling
* Data structures (lists, tuples, and dictionaries)
* Searching and sorting
* Creating functions
* Documentation (comments and docstrings)
* Design, decomposition, and debugging


## Comparison Course: Introduction to Python

The curriculum I found to compare to is [datacamp's Introduction to Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science).
Unlike my course, its emphasis is on data science and learning the use of python for very basic data science purposes. While the end goal 
of their course is much more limited than the end goal of mine, I found that it had some useful components that I would like to
spend more time examining and model some of my own materials after.

The units in this course are:
* Python Basics (variables, types, and operations)
* Python Lists (indexing, slicing, adding/deleting/changing elements)
* Functions and Packages (built-in and package functions, string and list methods)
* Numpy (numpy arrays, 2D numpy arrays, basic numpy statistics)


# Major Differences

The most obvious major difference is that the datacamp course is much more limited in scope. There is no discussion of conditionals, loops, or 
defining functions - all topics that are absolutely fundamental to programming. Even in the world of data science, this is an extremely 
limited introduction to statistical programming. There is an additional course called
[Intermediate Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-python) that brings the level of programming to what I would consider
a more reasonable level; while it continues to emphasize data manipulation and analysis, it does finally introduce control structures.

Because of the difference in priorities (and the fact that it's intended as two 4-hour courses for an adult working in data science),
the order of topics is very far from what I would choose for an intro programming course; there are many different orders that can be
appropriate, but I would not consider leaving conditionals and loops for nearly 3/4 of the way through even a statistical programming course.
There are also several statistical topics that are naturally not included in my coursework.

Also missing from these two courses is any substantial design efforts. I anticipate that by the end of my course, my students will be able to
design and create a program to some larger specification using several user-made functions. Even within the second unit of study (flow control),
I ask students to design a text-based adventure with several branching choices that could lead to rather long blocks of code. Where this 
course does introduce a task to complete, the task tends to be very short and reduces it to small bite-sized pieces. There are no open-ended
exercises; the user only needs to write a handful of lines of code.


# Major Similarities

Similarities between my curriculum and the datacamp curriculum can be found mostly in my earlier exploratory lessons and simpler exercises.
In these cases, I have students run a line or two of code at a time to see how it behaves, and I break down multi-step tasks into smaller pieces
via comment. These are similar approaches to the interactive exercises that the datacamp course uses. The use of code starters, prompts to make 
changes to improve code, and guided coding are all similar to approaches I am building in to many of my lesson materials.

Another similarity is the subdividing of concepts into multiple subconcepts or sometimes just using multiple lessons on the same concept. 
When I cover conditional statements, I expect to spend at least four lessons on the topic before introducing anything else; there are areas when 
even datacamp's 4-hour courses choose to spend several lessons on an important topic (for example, while their lessons are much shorter than 
40 minutes, approximately 6 lessons are devoted to slicing and subsetting lists). 


# Strengths and Weaknesses

The greatest strength that my course has over the datacamp course is the use of design projects and more complex code segments. I also believe 
that due to the difference in lesson duration, my materials allow for greater practice opportunities and chances to dive deeper into the
concepts covered. 

My course's greatest weakness is the lack of polish in my materials and lessons. Because I am new to teaching programming, I expect to discover 
that some of my materials and lessons will be "rough" and I will have a great deal of space to improve them for next year. I expect to have
some difficulty with pacing in particular as I learn what my students can accomplish in 40 minutes.

The datacamp curriculum has a really user-friendly interface for the interactive components. There are directions on the left pane of the page,
and the right pane includes a section to write and run a script as well as an interactive shell. As an online platform, it makes excellent use of
the layout to be easily accessible to a user. I am also impressed with the subdivision of topics into manageable pieces - it makes the course
absolutely manageable as a self-paced learning experience.

 The datacamp course's greatest weakness is its limited scope. Putting aside the difference in audience, limiting itself to a 4-hour course
 meant that there was no room for more substantial projects. As I have background in statistical programming with R, I feel that the first 
 "beginner" course does not go nearly far enough. Adding the "intermediate" course helps, but I can't understand why the two are considered
 separate in the first place - I can't imagine doing any useful statistical programming without condiitons, loops, user-created functions,
 and graphical representations of data. Datacamp offers two more courses in python (Python Data Science Toolbox Parts 1 and 2) that seem 
 necessary to get to any level of useful proficiency, but even these miss any chance to have the user create a more substantial program - 
 or even to create a program from scratch. The scaffolding is very successful, but the leap a user would need to take from the course to
 actual statistical programming is intimidating.
 
 
# What I Will Adopt

The part of this datacamp course I am most impressed by is its user-friendliness and its subdivision of topics. I really appreciate the layout
and would like to choose the best way I can implement something similar using my chosen software, whether by directing students to use 
splitscreen layouts with a digital set of instructions or by using the built-in VS Code splitscreen functionality to do something similar. Being
able to view everything at once (directions, your code, and the shell) makes the work much easier, and emulates the screen layout I used for
most of the prework and summer work. 

I would absolutely borrow some of the exercises used and the layouts of the comments/code stubs, particularly for the early lessons on
a particular topic before more substantial design projects are implemented. They are well scaffolded into bite-sized pieces, although I would
also build to less scaffolding later in a lesson or topic.
