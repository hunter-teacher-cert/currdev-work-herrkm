# Background

## My Course: Computer Programming

The course I am teaching and developing curriculum for is called "Computer Programming," but I refer to  as "Intro to Programming" to emphasize
that it is a beginner course. The language used is Python, and we will be using VS Code with the Python extension and the ipykernel package.
As of right now, I have a few weeks' worth of lessons planned and an overall sequence document, with the understanding that it is very much
a living document. I expect to extend lessons over multiple days as needed and add project-based sections, especially as students develop 
greater skills.

By the end of the course, students will be proficient with the following fundamental programming skills:

* Variables
* Basic data types and their operations
* Conditional statements
* Loops
* Input validation and error handling
* Data structures (lists, tuples, and dictionaries)
* Searching and sorting
* Creating functions
* Documentation (comments and docstrings)
* Design, decomposition, and debugging


## Comparison Course: Introduction to Python

The curriculum I found to compare to is [datacamp's Introduction to Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science).
Unlike my course, its emphasis is on data science and learning the use of python for very basic data science purposes. While the end goal 
of their course is much more limited than the end goal of mine, I found that it had some useful components that I would like to
spend more time examining and model some of my own materials after.

The units in this course are:
* Python Basics (variables, types, and operations)
* Python Lists (indexing, slicing, adding/deleting/changing elements)
* Functions and Packages (built-in and package functions, string and list methods)
* Numpy (numpy arrays, 2D numpy arrays, basic numpy statistics)
