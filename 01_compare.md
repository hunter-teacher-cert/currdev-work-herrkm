# Background
The course I am teaching and developing curriculum for is called "Computer Programming," but I refer to it
as "Intro to Programming" to emphasize that it is a beginner course. The language used is Python,
and we will be using VS Code with the Python extension and the ipykernel package. As of right now,
I have a few weeks' worth of lessons planned and an overall sequence document, with the understanding that
it is very much a living document. I expect to extend lessons over multiple days as needed and add
project-based sections, especially as students develop greater skills.

The curriculum I found to compare to is [datacamp's Introduction to Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science).
While the end goal of their course is more limited than the end goal of mine, I found that it had some useful components that I would like to
spend more time examining and model some of my own materials after.
