# Language: Scratch

## 0. How does one write code in this language?

Scratch is a block-based language. Blocks are color coded and sorted into categories. A programmer selects a block from the library and drags it into the work space, typically locking it with other blocks to create a sequence of instructions.

## 1. How does one run code in this language?

Scratch code runs in the developing platform (both the web-based platform and presumably the app). A window displaying the relevant animation and game interface is present and can be made fullscreen.

## 2. Rate the complexity of the syntax?

Scratch's syntax is quite approachable - commands are generally written in plain English, with spaces where values may be placed. There is color-coding so that the type of block may be identified at a glance, and shapes of connectors can help students understand how commands do and do not connect. The only downsides I see are perhaps biased from a text-based perspective: I would love a way to collapse large blocks for organization, and  I find myself missing the visual organization of indented text. The programmer can organize the blocks of code however they please in their work space, which may make the inability to collapse less of an issue.

## 3. Strengths

Scratch's greatest strength is its low barrier to entry. Block code has the advantage of having structures built in so that programmers can find a command instead of memorizing a large selection of commands before they can really get started. It allows for repetition and conditional logic, as well as the definition of functions and variables; programmers can use the same structures that text-based languages use, even if the syntax is different. Scratch also is focused on the creation of visuals, games, and other interactive programs. This is likely to be engaging for new programmers who may not expect to enjoy programming or who may not have an innate interest in programming for its own sake.

## 4. Weaknesses

It seems that very large projects on Scratch may develop lag when played. This is unlikely to become an issue until toward the end of the course, as students will need to develop their understanding of programming structures before they can create anything too complex. The inability to collapse blocks of code will also lead to some inconvenience given that students would likely be using Chromebooks for the course, thereby being stuck with a small screen. The use of costumes and sounds for visual and auditory components of programs allows for great student creativity, but could definitely become a "rabbit hole" where students dive into the details of the visuals and sounds instead of creating a working program.

## 5. What classes would this be good for?

Scratch seems well tailored for an introduction to programming concepts or for an introduction to game design or visual design concepts. It also allows a lot of creativity on the part of the students. I would be inclined to use this language for early programming courses targeted at MS students or early HS students with no prior background in programming concepts.

# Language: Processing

## 0. How does one write code in this language?

Processing is a text-based language. It appears similar to Java.

## 1. How does one run code in this language?

While I did not download Processing to try it, it seems that it can be run within the Processing editor.

## 2. Rate the complexity of the syntax?

The syntax looks very similar to that of Java. From the code samples I viewed, there doesn't seem to be as much structural syntax (like with Java's required main method), but Processing uses curly brackets, semicolons, and variable declarations much like Java does.

## 3. Strengths

Processing seems well designed for graphic design and artistic creation. The syntax is similar enough to that of other text-based languages that the transition from Python or Java to Processing would not be arduous. 

## 4. Weaknesses

It is not clear to me what functional weaknesses Processing might have; the syntax and requirement for understanding of coordinates and functions may make it less accessible to younger students, but otherwise it seems well-designed for its purpose.

## 5. What classes would this be good for?

Processing would be best suited for art classes with an emphasis on computer-based tools or CS courses with an emphasis on artistic design. Definitely HS-level classes.
