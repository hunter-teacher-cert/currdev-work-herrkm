# Tool 1: Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is an IDE that can be used for many different languages. It can be used to develop code in a wide variety of languages, but my Intro to Computer Programming class uses it to write Python code. Students make use of the integrated terminal and the interactive Python shell; they develop programs to complete simple tasks or to create a larger and more complex program such as a text-based adventure game. I selected VS Code on the advice of a software engineer I know who described it as an "industry standard," although it isn't the tool he personally uses, and because it was a tool I also have used in the past.

# Tool 2: Google Drive

Google Drive is used to store and share files. I use it in my Programming class so that students can easily share their files with me. Because of my IT department's rules, I am unable to use Github for file sharing; as a result, I have installed Drive for Desktop on my laptop and set it to sync a folder containing the students' work folders to my laptop. As a result, I can open and run their files from my computer after the students upload them into Google Drive to turn them in. I selected this tool out of necessity, as I was not able to have my students make Github accounts and my IT department was not able to use our district network to give me access to the files through the students' drives due to the way the student laptops are currently being managed. This was the most effective way to access student work without adding extra steps downloading files.
